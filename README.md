# hrcloset
### This app is for stocking and using supplies from the second floor electrical closets at Heritage Halls

## Using the App
1. The most common use of this web app is to take an item from one of the closets to perform a repair. To track this action, navaigate to hr.theblcky.com and choose the building from the dropdown menu. Use the '-' button to account for the item you took.
2. To take inventory, use the '+' and '-' buttons to make the online database agree with what is in the closet. If you want to add an item that isn't on the list or remove an item from the list, click the Admin link at the bottom of the page and make the change (see instructions below).

## Using the Admin Page
From the Admin Page you should be able to make any changes you want to the list of supplies and the buildings.

### Items that are stocked
Use this section to change the items in a building. If you fill out the building and item fields you can remove the item from the list. When adding an item, be sure to include the number in the closet (put 0 if you don't know) and the number that the closet should have for full stock.
### Add/Delete a Building
This really shouldn't need to be used until the new buildings come in 2020.
